## Description
PlantWise is a full-stack web application designed to help gardeners â€” both beginners and experts â€” make informed planting decisions based on real-time and historical weather data.

The application integrates external climate APIs and a custom plant database to deliver personalized planting calendars and growth recommendations based on location and plant type for Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the contiguous United States.
